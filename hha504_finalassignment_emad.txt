# to start this project first task is to set up an Azure Virtual Machine (VM)

# This process begins with creating a free Microsoft Account via StonyBrook.edu email address

# Through Azure portal, more services tab -> compute -> virtual machine -> create

# you are able to create your VM. 

# Via sunscriptions menue you are able to add student subscription (Azure for students 12 months free)

# now it is time to define your virtual machine. my VM name : emadserver

# Region: useast, Security type : Standard, Availability option (Is a logicall grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is build to provide for redundancy and availability [docs.microsoft.com])

# Authentication type for this instance is password (username, password and IP addresses are provided in an other file).

# To add mysql port (port 3306) navigate to Networking tab -> add inbound security ->rule -> service -> add mysql (port 3306)

# to connect remotly to my Azure VM, first I connect to it via terminal on my machine (ssh command)

# updated my VM  (sedo apt-get update)

# next step is to install mysql on the virtual machine (mysql -server mysql-client

# To creat dba user with certain passwor I used this code : 'dba'@'%'identifiedby'XXXXXXX'

# Confirmed it  by select user from mysql.user;

# Grant all privileges to dba user : *.*to'dba'@'%'with grant option;

# show grants for dba;  to confirm

# Creating e2e database is probably the easiets step: create database e2e;

# The essential code set to pull down h1n1 table and nest it e2e is provided in a separate Google colab notebook.

# To create a physical back up (dump): sudo mysqldump e2e>e2e_dump.sql

# and final step is to copy the back up to the local machine: scp emad@VM IP address:/home/emad/e2e_dump.sql ./downloads 

# h1n1_concern_trigger

if new.h1n1_concern > 3 then
	signal sqlstate '45000'
    set message_text = 'H1N1 concern should be a numerical value between 0 and 3. please try again';
  end if;
  end; $$
